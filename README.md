<h1>Music Composer Deep Learning</h1>

This project is a part of the AAI-511 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the
University of San Diego (USD).

-- Project Status: Active

<h2>Project Intro/Objective <h2>
<p>The main purpose of this project is to analyze the musical composers dataset and create a model that can predict which composer wrote a given piece of music. The provided dataset is from the Kaggle website and includes midi files for many composers, this project only looks at Mozart, Bach, Beethoven and Chopin. The two models trained in this project are an LSTM model and a CNN model.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
The Final_combined notebook combines the different EDA methods as well as the CNN and LSTM models into one notebook. Since these two models have different architectures and requirements, this single notebook does not contain the runtime outputs. Those are captured in the individual notebooks titled LSTM_Final.ipynb and CNN_Final.ipynb. The combined notebook discusses each section as well as the methods used in each, but due to the long training times, the outputs were not run. 

<h3>Selected Dataset </h3>
<p>The dataset was provided from the Kaggle Website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blanderbuss/midi-classic-music)</p>
